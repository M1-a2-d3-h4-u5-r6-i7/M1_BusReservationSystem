# BUS RESERVATION SYSTEM
# INTRODUCTION:-
Online Bus Ticket Reservation System is a Web based application that works within a 
centralized network. This project presents a review on the software program “Online Bus Ticket 
Reservation System” as should be used in a bus transportation system, a facility which is used to 
reserve seats, cancellation of reservation and different types of route enquiries used on securing 
quick reservations. OBTRS is built for managing and computerizing the traditional database, 
ticket booking and tracking bus and travel made. It maintains all customer details, bus details, 
reservation details. In order to achieve the design, Imo Transport Company (ITC) was chosen as 
a case study because of its strategic importance to Imo State. Structured Systems Analysis and 
Design Methodology (SSADM) was adopted. In addition, PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) 
language was used for the front- end of the software while the back end was designed using 
MySQL. The software achieved is capable of improving the customer hand and relationship 
management in ITC operations. It is recommended that despite the present functionality of the 
designed software, an additional functionality such as the use of E-mail to send tickets and 
notifications to the customer and an online payment using credit cards/debit cards should be 
implemented into the system. Furthermore, other operations carried by ITC such as the courier 
services should also be integrated in order to enhance the system.

# OBJECTIVES:-
i) Providing a web-based bus ticket reservation function where a customer can 
buy bus ticket through the online system without a need to queue up at the 
counter to purchase a bus ticket.

ii) Enabling customers to check the availability and types of busses online. 
Customer can check the time departure for every ITC bus through the 
system.

iii) Easing bus ticket payment by obtaining a bank pin after payments is made to
